{"question_id": 81, "text": " The Senate is considering a controversial rule change, known as the \"nuclear option,\" that would allow judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with just 51 votes instead of the current requirement of 60 votes. This change would significantly alter the power dynamic in the Senate, potentially allowing the majority party to confirm nominees without the support of the minority party. The idea of the \"nuclear option\" is not new, but it has gained more attention in recent years as the number of filibusters has increased. Some argue that this change would \"blow up\" the Senate and lead to a mutually assured destruction between the two parties. The Constitution does not specify the number of votes required for confirmation, leaving it up to the Senate to determine its own rules. The rule change is being considered in response to Republican efforts to block nominees to the D.C.
