According to Zimmerman's father, Robert, Trayvon Martin said something like \"You're going to die now\" or \"You're going to die tonight\" before he was shot. Robert Zimmerman also states that Martin continually beat his son, causing him to pull his pistol and shoot him. However, Martin's family attorney and several other legal experts dispute these claims, saying that the injuries Zimmerman sustained do not match the story he is giving. A surveillance video taken at police headquarters the night of the incident shows Zimmerman exiting a patrol car with his hands cuffed, but it does not show any close-up of his head. The case has sparked a national debate about racial profiling and the shooting has been declared a tragedy by President Barack Obama.

A recent poll found that President Obama would have a huge edge over Romney with Latino voters, with 68% supporting the Democrat over the Republican's 23%.\n\n Navarrette argues that Romney's attacks on other Republicans and his failure to acknowledge the contributions of illegal immigrants have made him a persona non grata with Latino voters.
