{"question_id": 50, "text": " Despite the absence of women in the Catholic Church's hierarchy, there is a persistent myth that a female pope once existed. This legend has captured the attention of many Catholics, particularly as the church continues to address issues of gender inequality. Despite the fact that women are not allowed to be ordained priests, they hold important executive positions in Catholic social and relief organizations. However, it appears that the Vatican's upper echelon is exclusively a male-dominated club, with no direct say in who will succeed Benedict XVI.\n\nDespite this, there are still calls for women to break through the stained glass ceiling and have a greater say in the church. The legend of Pope Joan, a mythical ninth-century Englishwoman who disguised herself as a priest, continues to appeal to new anxieties and interests. However, historians say the story is a nonsense boosting a good cause. Despite this, the legend endures, with believers asking why cardinals were asked to sit on a uniquely shaped chair into the 16th century.\n\nThe art on the walls at Rome's Church of St. Lucia highlights the central role that women have had in the church's past. Despite this, women cannot occupy important positions in the church because of their gender. Donna Orsuto, a professor from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, believes that a bit of female advice might help the church steer its way through troubled waters. Sister Mary Ann Walsh of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops also believes that women should have a greater say in the church's hierarchy.\n\nAlthough the idea of a female pope may be a distant possibility, it is not without precedent. According to legend, Pope Joan outdid all the men in her religious studies and rose through the ranks of the cardinals to become pope. Despite this, the church's hierarchy appears to be an exclusive men's club, with no direct say for women. Despite this, women's voices may be louder than before, but will there ever be a female pope?", "answer_id": "Bfw2Kkx9RgX9BPiRg9JjdX", "model_id": "llama2-13b", "metadata": {"skip_ratio": [9.99946239449492, 465]}}
{"question_id": 51, "text": " Maryland Man Dies of Rabies a Year and a Half After Receiving Tainted Organ.\n\nThree other people in Florida, Georgia, and Illinois are being treated with rabies vaccinations after doctors determined that the donor had died of encephalitis due to the rabies virus. Health care teams were immediately contacted, and doctors at the CDC determined that the donor had died of the same type of rabies, which is spread by raccoons, according to the CDC.\n\nDoctors knew the donor had encephalitis of unknown cause when they harvested the organs in September 2011, the CDC said. However, no rabies test was done before the donor's kidneys, heart, and liver were delivered for transplantation in September 2011.\n\nDr. Matthew Kuehnert, the CDC's acting director, said doctors were shocked to learn that the recipients' organs were tainted with rabies. Their first reaction was that it seemed unlikely because it's been almost a year and a half since the transplant, he said.\n\nIn the only other US outbreak of rabies among organ recipients, the four patients died within a month of transplantation. The three other recipients are being tested for rabies, and health authorities are looking for family members or health care workers who might have had close contact with the donor or the recipient who died of rabies, said CDC spokeswoman, Melissa Dankel.\n\nHealth officials are now giving anti-rabies shots to three other patients who received organs from the same donor as the Maryland man who died of rabies. The donor tested negative for several causes of encephalitis, including West Nile virus and herpes, Kuehnert said.\n\nDr. Richard Franman, the CDC's acting rabies team lead, said perhaps new rules need to be put in place to help doctors decide what to do with organs when the donor has died of encephalitis of unknown cause.\n\nAt least one transplant surgeon won't take organs when the donor has died of encephalitis of unknown origin. Other patients waiting for organs such as hearts or livers might die quickly if they don't receive anti-rabies shots, Franka said.\n\nAt least one transplant surgeon said perhaps new rules need to be put in place to help doctors decide what to do with organs when the donor has died of encephalitis of unknown cause.\n\nDoctors knew the donor had encephalitis of unknown cause when they harvested the organs in September 2011.

{"question_id": 66, "text": " In a long-standing dispute between a Nevada rancher and the federal land management, a confrontation escalated into a physical altercation this week. Cliven Bundy, a rancher from Nevada, has been refusing to comply with court orders to remove his cattle from the public land since 1993. \n\n\nThe dispute began when the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) changed grazing rules for the 600,000-acre Gold Butte area to protect an endangered desert tortise. Bundy, who has been ranching in the area since the 1800s, refused to abide by the changes and stopped paying grazing fees to the federal government. \n\nRecently, the BLM started rounding up his cattle, and this has led to confrontations between his supporters and the rangers, with Bundy saying that his family has been grazing on the land since the 1800s and that the federal government has seized Nevada's sovereignty. \n\nGovernment officials say that Bundy owes $1 million in unpaid grazing fees, but he claims that he has been grazing on the land since the 1800s and that the federal government has no right to seize his cattle. In a recent confrontation, bundy supporters confronted rangers, and a video of the incident was posted on YouTube. \n\nThe dispute between Bundy and the federal government has been going on for over two decades, with Bundy refusing to comply with court orders to remove his cattle from the public land. The BLM has been grazing on the land since the 1800s, and the federal government has been seizing his cattle since then. \n\nIn a recent confrontation, Bundy supporters confronted rangers, leading to a heated face-off between the two sides. The BLM has been rounding up his cattle since Saturday, and the dispute has now become a symbol of the ongoing struggle between state rights and federal power. \n\nIn conclusion, the long-standing dispute between Cliven Bundy and the federal government over grazing rights has escalated into a physical altercation, with Bundy supporters confronting rangers and the federal government rounding up his cattle. The dispute has become a symbol of the ongoing struggle between state rights and federal power, with both sides digging in for their positions.", "answer_id": "aQNT6UBmatCZUcXL7SmtX7", "model_id": "llama2-13b", "metadata": {"skip_ratio": [9.999535337577251, 538]}}

{"question_id": 77, "text": " A Tennessee juror's laudatory Facebook message to a medical examiner during a murder trial could null the jury's conviction in William Darelle Smith, the state's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. The high court did not immediately throw out Smith's first-degree murder conviction but decided that the juror's social networking communication with a key prosecution witness might have affected the trial's outcome.\n\nSmith's public defender declined to comment on the ruling, and the county district attorney's office did not immediately react to the news.\n\nThe trial judge did not order a hearing into the juror's interaction with the medical examiner, and the state Supreme Court overruled that decision, stating that the public's confidence in the fairness of the system necessitates that all jurors be held to the highest standards of conduct.\n\nThe state Supreme Court stressed that technology\u2014including the internet\u2014has complicated the matter of juror extraneous information or has been improperly influenced. The court stated that trial courts need to give jurors specific, understandable instructions that prohibit extraneous communications with third parties and the use of technology to obtain facts that have not been presented as evidence.\n\nIn conclusion, the state Supreme Court overruled that the juror's social networking communication with a key prosecution witness may have affected the trial's outcome and necessitates a new trial.", "answer_id": "V3ZEyvFZ58L98ddR753T7p", "model_id": "llama2-13b", "metadata": {"skip_ratio": [9.999196206092757, 311]}}

Nearly 90% of African-Americans express their certain belief in God, and 55% of them interpret scripture literally. Dr. Boyce Watkins, a professor at Syracs University, agrees that some black churches teach women to only date a man who goes to church regularly. Cooper offers two suggestions: find another church or leave and go where the boys are, such as tailgates, bars, and clubs. However, the Rev. Renita J. Weems disagrees, saying Cooper fails to examine deeper threads.
