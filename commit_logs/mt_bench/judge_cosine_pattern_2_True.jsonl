The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) can be calculated using the distance formula:\n\nd = \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2)\n\nSubstituting the given points (2, -2) and (10, 4) into the formula, we get:\n\nd = \u221a((10 - 2)\u00b2 + (4 - (-2))\u00b2)\n  = \u221a(8\u00b2 + 6\u00b2)\n  = \u221a(64 + 36)\n  = \u221a100\n  = 10\n\nSo, the length of the line segment is 10 units.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answers given by the two assistants:\n\nAssistant 1: The assistant correctly applied the distance formula and calculated the length of the line segment.
