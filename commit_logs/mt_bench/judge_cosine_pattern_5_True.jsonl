The length of a line segment with endpoints (x\u2081, y\u2081) and (x\u2082, y\u2082) can be found using the distance formula:\n\nd = \u221a((x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2)\n\nSubstituting the given endpoints (2, -2) and (10, 4) into the formula, we get:\n\nd = \u221a((10 - 2)\u00b2 + (4 - (-2))\u00b2)\n  = \u221a(8\u00b2 + 6\u00b2)\n  = \u221a(64 + 36)\n  = \u221a100\n  = 10\n\nSo, the length of the line segment is 10 units.\n\nNow, let's examine the problem-solving process of the two assistants.\n\nAssistant 1 correctly applied the distance formula and arrived at the correct answer. The steps were clear and easy to follow.\n\nAssistant 2, however, made a mistake in the problem-solving process. The assistant tried to subtract the coordinates as if they were single numbers, which is incorrect. The distance between two points in a 2D space cannot be found by simply subtracting the coordinates. The correct method is to use the distance formula, as Assistant 1 did.\n\nTherefore, the scores are:\n\n- Assistant 1: 10/10\n- Assistant 2: 3/10\n\nAssistant 1 performed better because it correctly applied the distance formula and provided a clear explanation. Assistant 2, on the other hand, used an incorrect method to find the distance.", "score": [-1, -1]}
