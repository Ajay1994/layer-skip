The assistant correctly distributed the 5 to the terms inside the parentheses, simplified the equation, and solved for x. The final answer, x = 10, is correct.\n\nAssistant 2:\nThe steps followed by Assistant 2 are incorrect. The assistant correctly distributed the 5 to the terms inside the parentheses, but made a mistake when adding 10 to both sides of the equation. The assistant added 10 to the left side but subtracted 10 from the right side, which is incorrect. This led to an incorrect final answer of x = -20.\n\nTherefore, the scores for Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 are (10, 2) respectively. Assistant 1 performed better because it correctly solved the equation, while Assistant 2 made a mistake in the process.", "score": [-1, -1]}
